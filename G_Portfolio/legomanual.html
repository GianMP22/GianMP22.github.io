                            <br>

                    <br>
                    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
                    <p>LEGO manuals require a certain attention to detail in order to be followed correctly. Some of the older manuals are so hard to read, they are akin to those "spot the difference" games.</p>
                    <div class="imgs-row">
                        <img class="imgs-in-row" src="images/Projects/LegoManual/Instruction_Ex_01.jpg" alt="LEGO manual spot-the-difference example 01">
                        <img class="imgs-in-row" src="images/Projects/LegoManual/Instruction_Ex_02.jpg" alt="LEGO manual spot-the-difference example 02">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Some more recent adaptations of the LEGO manual have attemped to single out the location of certian pieces that the user may miss (shown below).</p>
                    <img class="imgs" src="images/Projects/LegoManual/Instruction_Ex_03.jpg" alt="LEGO manual piece callout example ">
                    <p>
                        But this is the equivalent of putting baind-aid on a broken bone. It's not the ideal solution. The ideal solution for the instruction manual would be to create one with a closer visual design to the actual build process.
                        <br><br>
                        This is how I came up with the idea of a 3D animated version of the LEGO instruction manual. 
                        <br>
                        BONUS: I made it in AR too using the existing LEGO manual as an image tracker.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Process:</h2>
                    <p>My first step was to find a model to work off of. I went to the LEGO store and found a small Star Wars LEGO set to use as a reference.</p>
                    <p>I used Fusion 360 to model each unique piece in the set to use in the animation.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p>Then I went over to Cinema 4D to create the animation and texture each piece to be rendered.</p>

                    <h2>C4D Rendered Animation:</h2>
                    <p>On my first iteration I just focused on animating each step in a satisfying manner.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p>For my second iteration I wanted to implement some elements of a traditional LEGO instruction manual that I had lost in the beginning. Plus I wanted to show off all the details of the pieces I modeled in my animation.</p>

                    <h2>AR Version:</h2>
                    <p>This AR version was made with Snapchat's Lens Studio. But this lead to some problems.</p>
                    <h3>Problems:</h3>
                    <p>In a perfect world this AR version would track each page to their corresponding step. However, Lens Studio has a maximum of 10 image trackers which means I can only have a maximum of 10 steps - mine wouldnâ€™t even load my 5th tracker (probably a file size issue). Therefore, I opted to track front page to a full animations of all steps.</p>

                            <p>I had this great 3D model of an Iron Man Arc Reactor that I made in a 3D modeling class while learning Maya. I always wanted to post it but I never felt like it was good enough. Then, I enrolled in a virtual enhancement class which was designed to focus on texturing models rather than making them and I jumped at the chance to design a skin worthy of this model.</p>
