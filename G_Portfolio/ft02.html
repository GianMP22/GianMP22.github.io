                    <h3>#Prototype, #3Dprint, #CAD, #PersonalProject</h3>
                    <p>
                        For my 2nd prototype of the Mini Flamethrower I focued on improving upon JLaserVideo's 
                        original 3D print. I made the ignition more intuitive and built the circuit into the 
                        main body of the flamethrower.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    

                    <h2>Prototype Overview:</h2>
                    <p>As I said, this version of the mini flamethrower was just an edited version of Jake Laser's Flamethrower 3D model. 
                        I added cutouts to the main body to house the circuitboard and battery for the igniton as well as a few other modifications to the design, as seen below. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Ignition:</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this version, the igniton button is turned on before use and stays on the whole time. 
                        This ended up being a waste of the battery life as the ignition only needs to start the flame, after that the flame keeps itself burning.
                        Additionally, The ignition only needed to be installed in front of one of the 2 gas outputs because one ends up lighting the other. 
                        To engage the gas, I built a lever out of a bolt, 2 screws, and some metal I had lying around which I bent to be easily compressed by my middle and ring fingers. 
                        <br>
                        As you can probably tell, this build was made from whatever I had on hand. But if the Iron Man movies 
                        taught me anything, it's one man's box of scraps is another man's working prototype.

                                on how to make a very small flamethrower with a very simple lighter hack. This version was essentially a proof-of-concept as my first attempt at making a mini flamethrower.

                            <p>This flamethrower was the best working version...while it was actually working. 
                                This prototype was an experiment on how small I could make the flamethrower and still have all the functionality I wanted. 
                                I also decided to make it hand-held to make it safer to use. 
                                Although nice and portable, the small size made it extremely fragile.
