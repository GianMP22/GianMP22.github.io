                    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
                    <p>I had the idea for this project while living at home. My parents go to sleep around 8-10pm but I'm a night owl so I kept finding myself walking through our apartment in pitch darkness because my pjs don't have pockets and I sometimes didn't want to be holding my phone in my hand when I'm going to the kitchen for a midnight snack and some water (which I would need both hands for). My idea was to make a hands-free (i.e. wearable) flashlight that I could use to illuminate my path in the dead of night.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Process:</h2>
                    <p>First, I dug through my spare super bright LEDs and I found one bright enough that was from an old flashlight. I then took measurments of the LED and the bi-state switch I wanted to use.</p>
