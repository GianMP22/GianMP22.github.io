                        </a> 
                        The hack works by removing the fuel restrictor from a normal lighter so it dumps out all the fuel it can get through its nozzle in around 5-7 seconds.

                    <h2>Prototype Overview:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Whenever I told my friends about my flamethrower projects, the question I get asked a lot is "when can I get one?".
                        The last few flamethrowers took months of planning and prototyping, so the goal with this one was to make it faster and easier to produce.
                        There were also a few mechanisms I wanted to add to the flamethrower that I thought would help the functionality of the final product.
                        To make iterating easier on myself I started prototyping one mechanism at a time. 
                        The one I had the clearest mental image of was the Cartridge Ejection mechanism. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    

                    <h2>Mechanism 01: Cartridge Ejection</h2>
                    <p>I made the body of the flamethrower out of an aluminum casing I took off a plasma lighter. 
                        The opening of the aluminum case was then widened out to match the size of the lighter cartridge. 
                        This design decision means each lighter cartridge needs a gas lever bolted to the top in order to work with this prototype. 
                        The addition of the gas lever to the lighters makes swapping cartridges really easy and fluid: 
                        when one is empty, just pull the lever away from the case to remove the used cartridge and slip in a new one. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Ignition:</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this version, the ignition is activated by a push button just next to the gas release lever, 
                        making the gas release & ignition operational in one move but allowing the user to move their finger away from the ignition button after the flame is produced without interfering with their pressure on the gas release lever.
                        The circuitboard for the ignition as well as a safety switch (which disconnects the ignition from the 
                        battery when the flamethrower is not in use) were both added to the back of the aluminum casing with 
                        a 3D printed cover and an aluminum strip that matched the contour of the circuitboard.
                    </p>

                                For my 2nd prototype of the Mini Flamethrower I focued on improving upon JLaserVideo's 
                                original 3D print. I made the ignition more intuitive and built the circuit into the 
                                main body of the flamethrower.
