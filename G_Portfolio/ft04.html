                        The hack works by removing the fuel restrictor from a normal lighter so it dumps out all the fuel it can get through its nozzle in around 5-7 seconds.

                    <h2>Prototype Overview:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Whenever I told my friends about my flamethrower projects, the question I get asked a lot is "when can I get one?".
                        The last few flamethrowers took months of planning and prototyping, so the goal with this one was to make it faster and easier to produce.
                        There were also a few mechanisms I wanted to add to the flamethrower that I thought would help the functionality of the final product.
                        To make iterating easier on myself I started prototyping one mechanism at a time. 
                        The one I had the clearest mental image of was the Cartridge Ejection mechanism. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    

                    <h2>Mechanism 01: Cartridge Ejection</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first mechanism I focused on was the cartridge ejection. 
                        I  spent a lot of time before I started thinking out how I wanted this to sound and feel for the user interacting with it. 
                        I knew I wanted a pinch mechanism to release the lighter cartridge. 
                        I also wanted the reload to be quick just in case the user found themself in a dangerous situation and needed more fuel than one cartridge could hold. 
                        So I started with a lever and a spring.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The body was designed to be bent on the thin bridges called living hinges (close to the center of the model) so that it could be 3D printed with no supports. 
                        This saves on filament and print time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After printing, the living hinges are bent 90° and bolted together as shown below.

                    <h2>Mechanism 02: Ignition Circuit Board</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another integral piece to this project’s functionality is the ignition; you can’t have fire without the spark. 
                        For this piece, I knew I wanted to activate the ignition with a slide switch. 
                        One of the problems of my last mini flamethrower was ease and control over the ignition. 
                        After 1 failed attempt at making this by trying to bolt the PCB on the side of the body, 
                        I decided to ditch the screws and lock it in utilizing the symmetry of the two halves of the body.

                        Another notable difference from the last iteration is the addition of larger pads for the ejection pinch mechanism to minimize user error.

                    <h2>Mechanism 03: Gas Trigger</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the ignition set up, I got to focus on the trigger for the gas. 
                        In order to keep the size as small as possible I just made a trigger that extended the gas lever on the lighter towards my finger. 
                        I also decided to flip the side the pinch mechanism was on after a friend of mine said it might make the eject cartridge action a bit more fluid for the user. 
                        This made room for the Tesla coils above the ignition PCB board which will step the 3.7V from the battery to something that can make an arc of plasma to act as our ignition.

                                original 3D print. I made the ignition more intuitive and built the circuit into the 
                                main body of the flamethrower.

                            <p>This flamethrower was the best working version...while it was actually working. 
                                This prototype was an experiment on how small I could make the flamethrower and still have all the functionality I wanted. 
                                I also decided to make it hand-held to make it safer to use. 
                                Although nice and portable, the small size made it extremely fragile.

                            <p>The first one I made of these was as a kid out of cardboard. It was a simple stack of cardboard to give dimensionality and silver duct tape to make the blade look shiny. After the blade got a single bend in it, it became unusable. Utilizing 3D printing I designed a new sword to have a light-up crystal and a blade to be printed on a Creality Belt printer.</p>

                            <p>The idea for this project was to utilize a microcontroller's ability to perform keypresses in order to redefine how the game is played. I chose Nidhogg because it has a relatively simple gameplay and my friends enjoy playing this game together as a 1v1.</p>
