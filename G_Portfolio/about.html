                    I use my knowledge of 3D printing and 
                    3D modeling combined with my skills in 
                    physical fabrication to transform ideas 
                    into high-fidelity prototypes.
                    <br>
                    While my talent exists in the physical world, 
                    my education is from NYUâ€™s Engineering school, 
                    specifically in Media and Design; meaning I have 
                    skills in digital entertainment/design, as well as 
                    CAD and other methods of manufacturing.
                    <br>
                    I was inspired initially as a young boy 
                    to be an engineer when I saw Kato in Green Hornet 
                    who used his engineering talents to fight crime. 
                    <!-- Then, in 2019 as I was graduating high school, 
                    I lost a twin sister who had always encouraged 
                    my engineering endeavors and my dreams of becoming 
                    an inventor. I continue to do this work because she 
                    believed in my talents. -->
