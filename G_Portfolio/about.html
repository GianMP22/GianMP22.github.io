                    <p>
                        I use my knowledge of 3D printing and 
                        3D modeling combined with my skills in 
                        physical fabrication to transform ideas 
                        into high-fidelity prototypes.
                        <br>
                        While my talent exists in the physical world, 
                        my education is from NYUâ€™s Engineering school, 
                        specifically in Media and Design; meaning I have 
                        skills in digital entertainment/design, as well as 
                        CAD and other methods of manufacturing.
                        <br>
                        I was inspired initially as a young boy 
                        to be an engineer when I saw Kato in Green Hornet 
                        who used his engineering talents to fight crime. 
                        <!-- Then, in 2019 as I was graduating high school, 
                        I lost a twin sister who had always encouraged 
                        my engineering endeavors and my dreams of becoming 
                        an inventor. I continue to do this work because she 
                        believed in my talents. -->
