                    <p>
                        I use my knowledge of 3D printing and 
                        3D modeling combined with my skills in 
                        physical fabrication to transform ideas 
                        into high-fidelity prototypes.
                        <br>
                        While my talent exists in the physical world, 
                        my education is from NYU’s Engineering school, 
                        specifically in Media and Design; meaning I have 
                        skills in digital entertainment/design, as well as 
                        CAD and other methods of manufacturing.
                        <br><br>
                        When it comes to the things I make, form follows function. 
                        What the invention does and how I want the user 
                        to interact with the invention constitutes its design. 
                        I create through trial and error, 
                        through endlessly tweaking my design until 
                        the invention becomes what it always wanted to be. 
                        Whenever I make something my designs don’t come from me exactly, 
                        the invention speaks through me, 
                        and I give it the form it wants within the constraints 
                        I deem necessary (plus maybe some stylish flair). 
                        For this reason, I don’t consider myself a dreamer, 
                        but I love to serve the dreamers, 
                        and through my hands their dreams can take physical form.
                        <br>
                        I love inventing, but dreaming is an integral part of inventing. 
                        Inventions are tools for us to interact with the world around us. 
                        The tools we have access to inevitably control how we live our lives. 
                        <br>
                        It’s up to the dreamers to dream up a better life, 
                        to decide what tools this world needs, and it’s up to 
                        the people like me to make those tools a reality. 
                        
                        
                        <!-- I was inspired initially as a young boy 
                        to be an engineer when I saw Kato in Green Hornet 
                        who used his engineering talents to fight crime.  -->
                        <!-- Then, in 2019 as I was graduating high school, 
                        I lost a twin sister who had always encouraged 
                        my engineering endeavors and my dreams of becoming 
                        an inventor. I continue to do this work because she 
                        believed in my talents. -->
