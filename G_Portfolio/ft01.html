                        on how to make a very small flamethrower with a very simple lighter hack. 
                        This version was essentially a proof-of-concept as my first attempt at making a mini flamethrower.

                    <h2>Prototype Overview:</h2>
                    <p>Similar to Jake Laser's flamethrower, mine was also wrist-mounted because I wanted to be a superhero. 
                        My own version was made out of a TicTac container (this was before I had a 3D printer). 
                        Because of this this version of the mini flamethrower was double barreled 
                        (takes 2 lighter cartridges instead of 1) which was overkill so I scaled down in the 
                        <a href="ft02.html" style="font-size: 15px; font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold;" target="_self">
                            next iteration.
                        </a>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Ignition:</h2>
                    <p>
                       
                        In this version, the igniton button (located on the rear top of the body of the flamethrower) is turned on before use and stays on the whole time. 
                        This ended up being a waste of the battery life as the ignition is only needed to start the flame, after that the flame keeps itself burning.
                        Additionally, the ignition only needed to be installed in front of one of the 2 lighter nozzles (gas output) because one ends up lighting the other during the fire throwing process. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Gas:</h2>
                    <p>
                        To engage the gas, I built a lever out of a bolt, 2 screws, and some metal I had lying around which I bent to be easily compressed by my middle and ring fingers. 
                        The hinge these pivoted on was made from a binder clip so I could lock the lever in the upright positon when I wasn't using it.

                        As you can probably tell this build was made from whatever I had on hand, but if the Iron Man movies 
                        taught me anything, it's one man's box of scraps is another man's working prototype.

                                For my 2nd prototype of the Mini Flamethrower I focued on improving upon JLaserVideo's 
                                original 3D print. I made the ignition more intuitive and built the circuit into the 
                                main body of the flamethrower.

                            <p>This flamethrower was the best working version...while it was actually working. 
                                This prototype was an experiment on how small I could make the flamethrower and still have all the functionality I wanted. 
                                I also decided to make it hand-held to make it safer to use. 
                                Although nice and portable, the small size made it extremely fragile.
