                    <p>
                        While working as a Production Assistant for NYU's R-Lab under Todd Bryant, I was tasked to create a banner for his virtual 3D talk show <i>Planet Real-Time</i>. The only direction I was given was this a few clips from their episodes and the main theme behind the show: merging the real and digital worlds. 
                        <br>After going through the avaliable footage I picked out two frames in which the camera first showed a fully textured cloud and rainbow environment and then blinked to a wireframe version of the same environment. I split these two frames in half and made a pixeled gradient between them in photoshop. Then I overlayed the text "Planet Real-Time" in the center and used the same pixel gradient to split the lettering into a flat white side and a glowing side.
                        <br>My idea was this image would represent "pulling back the curtian" on the digital world to reveal it's place in the real world. Embodying the message of the virtual production.
