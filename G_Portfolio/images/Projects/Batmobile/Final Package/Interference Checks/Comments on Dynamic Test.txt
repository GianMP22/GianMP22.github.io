In the video, the rack and pinion steering mechanism is taken 
from its limit on one side to its limit at the other. As the video
shows, once the tie rod hits the rack both contacting faces light up 
and the motion stops. This occurs after approximately once full turn
of the steering wheel, which corresponds to an angle of about 45 degrees
either side of the neutral axis. We judge this to meet the expected
turning requirements of the vehicle and deem the results of the test
to be satisfactory.
