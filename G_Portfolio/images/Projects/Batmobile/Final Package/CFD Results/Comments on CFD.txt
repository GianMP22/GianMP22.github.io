The front flow diagram shows that the wind speed over the top and upper sides of the batmobile
is high, indicating low aerodynamic drag in these areas. By reducing the frictional loss
due to contact with air particles, the batmobile is more fuel efficient and, more importantly, 
able to convert more of its enginer power to forward movement. This will allow Batman to evade
enemies with inferior automobiles. However, the sides of the car create drag as shown by the 
yellow and green flow lines of slower moving air. The Batmobile could be better designed to
minimise drag in these areas, perhaps by removing the side tubes. Finally, we note that air 
speed under the car drops to almost zero - presumably due to friction with the ground. The 
Batmobile fails to exploit ground effect, where fast moving aid under the car sucks the car to 
the ground and thereby creates more downforce and allows for greater speeds. While this 
improves the drivability of the Batmobile and eliminates the possibility of porpoising, 
enemies may be able to exploit this deficiency and gain the advantage in a car chase. As is 
seen in the steering wheel insignia, the Batmobile is created in Mercedes and is therefore
accurate to the ability of F1 mercedes to successfully harness the power of ground effect.
